## Task 1 - Traceroute

A programme simulating linux command `$ traceroute -I ip_address`, sending ICMP packages with increasing values of TTL. The detailed description can be found [here](traceroute/p1.pdf).

## Task 2 - Router

A programme simulating behavior of router using distance vector algorithm. On input the program receives the neighboring subnetworks as well as the distance to them. To test the programme you have to launch at least 3 instances on different computers or VMs. [Here](exercises/w4.pdf) in exercise 3, there is a tutorial on how to configure such VMs. The detailed description can be found [here](router/p2.pdf).

## Task 3 - transport

A programme that downloads a file from a server using UDP packages and sliding window algorithm instead of very slow *stop-and-wait* approach. The detailed description can be found [here](transport/p3.pdf).

## Task 4 - WWW server

Simple HTTP server. The detailed description can be found [here](www-server/p4.pdf).
